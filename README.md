# House-prices
This is the famous House prices Kaggle challenge. I solved this problem using R Multiple linear regression.
In This project i have used 2 different methods in R. using the MLR i was able to achive a more accurate model than the RF model. which was suprisng. this might by a result of this being my secong Kaggle project and one of my early attempts in machine learning without any sufficent knowlage in the hyperparametters and data manipulation.

In the project you will find my results from each models. I decided to use backward elimination in the models to leave only the segnificant coefficients and to have a powerfull,yet very simple, model.
